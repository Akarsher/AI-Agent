Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Its instruction prompt gets long and confusing. It's hard to debug (which part failed?), difficult to maintain, and often produces unreliable results.\n\n**The Solution: A Team of Specialists**\n\nInstead of one \"do-it-all\" agent, we can build a **multi-agent system**.

Main Sections:**\n\n*   **Section 1: What Exactly ARE Multi-Agent Systems (and Why Should You Care)?**\n    *   Briefly define multi-agent systems (MAS) as collections of autonomous, interacting entities (agents) working towards a common goal or individual objectives.\n    *   Highlight the core concept: decentralization, collaboration, and emergent behavior.\n    *   Explain why this is relevant to developers: moving beyond traditional, centralized architectures for greater flexibility and power.\n\n*   **Section 2: Boosting Development Efficiency and Scalability**\n    *   **Modular Design & Reusability:** Agents can be designed as independent, self-contained units, making code easier to manage, debug, and reuse across different projects.\n    *   **Parallel Processing & Distribution:** MAS naturally lend themselves to parallel execution, allowing for distributed computing and significantly improved performance and scalability for demanding applications.\n    *   **Fault Tolerance & Robustness:** If one agent fails, the system can often continue operating or adapt, leading to more resilient and fault-tolerant software solutions.\n\n*   **Section 3: Empowering Smarter, More Adaptive Software**\n    *   **Complex Problem Solving:** MAS excel at tackling intricate problems that are difficult for single programs, by breaking them down into manageable tasks for individual agents.\n    *   **Dynamic Environment Interaction:** Agents can sense, reason, and act in real-time, making them ideal for applications that need to adapt to changing conditions (e.g., simulations, robotics, smart grids).\n    *   **Emergent Intelligence & Collective Behavior:** Observe how simple agent interactions can lead to sophisticated, unplanned system-level behaviors, unlocking new possibilities for AI-driven applications.\n\n*   **Section 4: Real-World Applications and Getting Started**\n    *   **Examples:** Briefly touch upon areas like supply chain management, intelligent tutoring systems, swarm robotics, financial trading, and network management.\n    *   **Tooling & Frameworks:** Mention some popular MAS development platforms or languages (e.g., JADE, NetLogo, REPAST Simphony, potentially libraries in Python/Java).\n    *   **Mindset Shift:** Emphasize that adopting MAS requires a shift in thinking from sequential execution to concurrent, collaborative processes.\n\n**4. Concluding Thought:**\n\nThe world of software development is constantly evolving, and multi-agent systems represent a significant leap forward. By embracing this paradigm, you're not just building software; you're architecting intelligent, resilient, and scalable ecosystems. So, step beyond the single thread and start exploring the incredible potential of multi-agent systems – your future applications will thank you for it.\nWriterAgent > ## Beyond the Single Thread: Unleashing Superpowers with Multi-Agent Systems\n\nAre you tired of wrestling with monolithic codebases, struggling to scale complex applications, or feeling like your software development process is stuck in a single-lane highway? What if there was a way to build more robust, adaptable, and intelligent systems by thinking differently about how your software components interact? Get ready to discover the power of multi-agent systems – a paradigm shift that can revolutionize how you code and the solutions you create.\n\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) are essentially collections of autonomous, interacting entities, or \"agents,\" each working towards a common goal or individual objectives. The core concepts here are decentralization, collaboration, and emergent behavior. For developers, this means moving beyond traditional, centralized architectures to embrace greater flexibility and power.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits is boosted development efficiency and scalability. Agents can be designed as independent, self-contained units, making code easier to manage, debug, and reuse. This modularity naturally lends itself to parallel processing and distributed computing, significantly improving performance and scalability for demanding applications. Furthermore, MAS offer enhanced fault tolerance; if one agent fails, the system can often adapt and continue operating, leading to more resilient software.\n\nMAS also empower smarter, more adaptive software. They excel at tackling complex problems by breaking them down into manageable tasks for individual agents. This makes them ideal for applications that need to interact with dynamic environments in real-time, such as simulations, robotics, or smart grids. Witnessing simple agent interactions lead to sophisticated, unplanned system-level behaviors unlocks exciting possibilities for AI-driven applications.\n\nFrom supply chain management to financial trading, the applications are vast. While adopting MAS requires a shift in thinking from sequential execution to concurrent, collaborative processes, the payoff is substantial. By embracing this paradigm, you're not just building software; you're architecting intelligent, resilient, and scalable ecosystems. So, step beyond the single thread and start exploring the incredible potential of multi-agent systems – your future applications will thank you for it.\nEditorAgent > ## Beyond the Single Thread: Unleashing Superpowers with Multi-Agent Systems\n\nAre you tired of wrestling with monolithic codebases, struggling to scale complex applications, or feeling like your software development process is stuck in a single-lane highway? What if there was a way to build more robust, adaptable, and intelligent systems by thinking differently about how your software components interact? Get ready to discover the power of multi-agent systems – a paradigm shift that can revolutionize how you code and the solutions you create.\n\nAt its core, a multi-agent system (MAS) is a collection of autonomous, interacting entities, known as \"agents,\" each pursuing its own objectives or contributing to a common goal. The fundamental principles here are decentralization, collaboration, and the potential for emergent behavior. For developers, this signifies a move away from traditional, centralized architectures towards a more flexible and powerful approach.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of adopting MAS is the boost to development efficiency and scalability. Agents can be designed as independent, self-contained units, which makes code significantly easier to manage, debug, and reuse across various projects. This inherent modularity naturally supports parallel processing and distributed computing, leading to substantial improvements in performance and scalability for even the most demanding applications. Moreover, MAS offer enhanced fault tolerance; if one agent encounters an issue, the system can often adapt and continue operating, resulting in more resilient software solutions.\n\nBeyond efficiency, MAS empower the creation of smarter, more adaptive software. They are exceptionally adept at tackling complex problems by decomposing them into manageable tasks that individual agents can handle. This makes them ideal for applications that require real-time interaction with dynamic environments, such as sophisticated simulations, robotics, or smart grids. Witnessing how simple agent interactions can lead to complex, emergent system-level behaviors opens up exciting new avenues for AI-driven applications.\n\nThe applications of MAS span a wide range, from optimizing supply chain management to developing sophisticated financial trading algorithms. While adopting MAS necessitates a shift in thinking from sequential execution to concurrent, collaborative processes, the rewards are substantial. By embracing this paradigm, you're not merely building software; you're architecting intelligent, resilient, and scalable ecosystems. So, step beyond the limitations of the single thread and start exploring the incredible potential of multi-agent systems – your future applications will undoubtedly benefit.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👏 Great job! You've now created a reliable \"assembly line\" using a sequential agent, where each step runs in a predictable order.\n\n**This is perfect for tasks that build on each other, but it's slow if the tasks are independent.** Next, we'll look at how to run multiple agents at the same time to speed up your workflow.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## 🛣️ Section 4: Parallel Workflows - Independent Researchers\n\n**The Problem: The Bottleneck**\n\nThe previous sequential agent is great, but it's an assembly line.

Running them in sequence would be slow and inefficient, creating a bottleneck where each task waits unnecessarily.\n\n**The Solution: Concurrent Execution**\n\nWhen you have independent tasks, you can run them all at the same time using a `ParallelAgent`. This agent executes all of its sub-agents concurrently, dramatically speeding up the workflow. Once all parallel tasks are complete, you can then pass their combined results to a final 'aggregator' step.\n\n**Use Parallel when:** Tasks are independent, speed matters, and you can execute concurrently.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [parallel agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Multi-Topic Research**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"User Request: Research 3 topics\"] -- > B[\"Parallel Execution\"]\n    B -- > C[\"Tech Researcher\"]\n    B -- > D[\"Health Researcher\"]\n    B -- > E[\"Finance Researcher\"]\n\n    C -- > F[\"Aggregator\"]\n    D -- > F\n    E -- > F\n    F -- > G[\"Combined Report\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffffcc\n    style F fill:#ffccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/parallel-agent.png\" alt=\"Parallel Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.1 Example: Parallel Multi-Topic Research\n\nLet's build a system with four agents:\n\n1. **Tech Researcher** - Researches AI/ML news and trends\n2. **Health Researcher** - Researches recent medical news and trends\n3. **Finance Researcher** - Researches finance and fintech news and trends\n4. **Aggregator Agent** - Combines all research findings into a single summary","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Tech Researcher: Focuses on AI and ML trends.\ntech_researcher = Agent(\n    name=\"TechResearcher\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Research the latest AI/ML trends.

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T17:39:46.187341Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T17:39:46.187994Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T17:39:46.193132Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T17:39:46.187965Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T17:39:46.192271Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

For twenty years, the rhythmic pulse of the lighthouse had been his only companion. Tonight, however, was different. A storm raged, and something tumbled onto the rocks below, catching the beam of his lantern. Cautiously, he descended, the wind a banshee’s shriek.\n\nThere, amidst the kelp and driftwood, lay a rolled parchment. It felt ancient, leathery. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. The map wasn't made of ink, but of a soft, phosphorescent glow, pulsing with an inner light. Strange, swirling symbols marked a course leading not to any known land, but into the inky abyss.\nCriticAgent > - The plot is intriguing, setting up a classic mystery with a fantastical element. However, the discovery of the map feels a bit too convenient. Consider adding a moment of peril or a more active struggle for Elias to retrieve the parchment, making the discovery feel earned.\n- Elias is established as a solitary figure, which is a good starting point. To make him more compelling, hint at *why* he sought such solitude for twenty years. Was he running from something, or simply content? A brief internal thought or a fleeting memory could add depth without slowing the pacing.\n- The pacing is good, building suspense effectively with the storm and the mysterious object. The description of the map is excellent. To enhance the sense of wonder and foreboding, consider adding a sensory detail beyond sight for the map itself – perhaps a faint hum, a strange warmth, or an unusual scent that accompanies its glow.\nRefinerAgent > The wind howled like a hungry wolf, each gust a physical blow against Elias’s weathered frame as he clung to the precarious cliff path. For twenty years, the lighthouse’s steady beam had been his silent confidante, a bulwark against the gnawing emptiness that had driven him to this desolate rock. He’d sought refuge from a past he couldn't outrun, a past that whispered in the shriek of the gale. Tonight, the storm was more than a tempest; it was a maelstrom of memories he thought long buried.\n\nA particularly violent wave crashed against the rocks below, dislodging something that tumbled, catching the sweeping lamplight. Not driftwood, not wreckage. Elias’s heart hammered against his ribs. He descended, his boots slipping on the slick, kelp-strewn stones. The wind tore at his oilskins, threatening to hurl him into the churning sea. He fought for every inch, the waves surging around his ankles, the salt spray stinging his eyes.\n\nFinally, he reached the object. It was a rolled parchment, surprisingly intact, secured with a brittle leather thong. As his numb fingers fumbled with the knot, a faint, ethereal hum vibrated through the parchment, a low thrum that seemed to resonate in his very bones. It felt strangely warm against his chilled skin, emitting a faint, ozone-like scent.\n\nWith a final tug, the thong snapped. Elias unrolled the parchment, and his breath hitched. It wasn't ink on vellum. The map glowed with an internal, phosphorescent light, swirling symbols pulsing like a slow, alien heartbeat. It depicted no coastline he recognized, no charted sea. Instead, it charted a course into the abyssal blackness, a path into the unknown depths. A chill, unrelated to the storm, snaked down his spine. This was no map of earthly waters, but a siren’s call to a realm beyond comprehension.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
